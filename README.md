 ### Description

 Workout Tracker is a fitness app that lets users view, create and track daily workouts. Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, they will be able to track the distance traveled. 

 The app is built using Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and Morgan.

 The live app can be accessed [here](https://pacific-stream-43723.herokuapp.com/).
